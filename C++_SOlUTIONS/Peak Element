A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.


   int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int l =0;
       int r = nums.size()-1;
       while(l<r){
           int mid = (l+r)/2;
           if(nums[mid]>nums[mid+1])
               r = mid;
           else 
               l=mid+1;
       }
        return l;
    }
